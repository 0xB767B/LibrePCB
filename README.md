LibrePCB Project Description
=========================

A free & OpenSource Schematic / Layout Editor

...just started... ;-)


## Development Requirements

To compile LibrePCB, you need the following software components:
- Qt >= 5.2
- A compiler with C++11 support

## Workspace

At the first startup, LibrePCB asks for a workspace directory where the library elements and projects will be saved.
For developers there is a demo workspace inclusive library and projects in this repository (subdirectory "dev/workspace/").
