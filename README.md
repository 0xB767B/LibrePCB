## About LibrePCB

LibrePCB is a free & OpenSource (GPLv3) Schematic / Layout Editor to develop printed circuit boards. The project is still in a quite early development status (no stable release available).

## Development Requirements

To compile LibrePCB, you need the following software components:
- Qt >= 5.2
- g++ or MinGW >= 4.8 (C++11 support is required)

## Workspace

At the first startup, LibrePCB asks for a workspace directory where the library elements and projects will be saved.
For developers there is a demo workspace inclusive library and projects in this repository (subdirectory "dev/workspace/").
