EDA4U Project Description
=========================

A free & OpenSource Schematic / Layout Editor

...just started... ;-)


## Development Requirements

To compile EDA4U, you need the following software components:
- Qt >= 5.2
- A compiler with C++11 support

## Workspace

At the first startup, EDA4U asks for a workspace directory where the library elements and projects will be saved.
For developers there is a demo workspace inclusive library and projects in this repository (subdirectory "dev/workspace/").
Creating new projects is not yet fully supported (for example adding new components to the schematic is not yet working),
so you should use only the already existing demo projects for testing.
