    @warning    Die hier beschriebenen Dinge sind keineswegs in Stein gemeisselt, es kann sich noch vieles verändern.
                Teilweise handelt es sich auch mehr um spontane Ideen, die noch weiter verfolgt werden sollten.
                Es ist gut möglich, dass einige dieser Ideen sich als nicht nützlich erweisen und dadurch wieder entfernt werden.
                Sie sind vorläufig einfach hier in der Doku festgehalten, damit sie nicht vergessen gehen.

    This is the documentation of an EDA4U project and all their specifications.
    
    
    
    
    @section project_file_structure_overwiew File Structure Overview
    
        There are two possibilities how an EDA4U project can be saved on the harddisc:
            - @ref file_structure_dir
            - @ref file_structure_zip
        
        
        @subsection file_structure_dir Seperate files in a directory
        
            This is the variant, how EDA4U always works internally on opened projects.
            All XML files, images and other files are stored in one directory and their subdirectories.
                
            With that method, the user is able to versioning a project with a version control system (SVN, GIT, ...).
            There can work many people on the same project at the same time, and merge their changes together.
                
            On opening such project, EDA4U will copy the whole project directory to a temporary directory.
            Now, all changes on the project will be saved in this temporary directory. 
            Only on saving a project, the project files will be written back to the original project directory to overwrite them.
            
        @subsection file_structure_zip ZIP-Archive *.e4u
                
            This is the "normal", recommended variant how to save EDA4U projects if you don't need a version controling system.
            The whole project directory with all their files will be compressed and saved in a ZIP archive.
            So the user has the whole project in one single file, which means:
                
                - There is no risk of inconsistence of files inside a project (because he cannot edit them manually)
                - The user's filesystem is cleaner, there are not "hundreds" of single files
                - It's easier to handle with one single file than with a whole directory (send it by e-mail, make copies and so on)
                
            Internally, EDA4U will simply extract the *.e4u ZIP archive to a temporary directory and changes will be made there.
            Every time you click "save project", this temporary directory will be zipped and the original *.e4u file will be overwritten.
            It's neary the same system like the one used in the variant "\ref file_structure_dir".




    @section project_file_hierarchy Project File Hierarchy
    
        In the project directory, there are only files from EDA4U, the user mustn't save other files there!
        There are the following directories and files in a EDA4U project directory:
        
            - @ref project_dir_boards "boards/"
                - board_name/
                    - ...
                - ...
            - @ref project_dir_lib "lib/"
                - {0af210c0-7625-4f8c-bc6d-c9f5b49b7024}/
                    - ...
                - ...
            - @ref project_dir_panels "panels/"
                - panel_name/
                    - ...
                - ...
            - @ref project_dir_schematics "schematics/"
                - schematic_name
                    - ...
                - ...
            - @ref project_dir_simulations "simulations/"
                - simulation_name
                    - ...
                - ...
            - @ref project_dir_user "user/"
                - ...
            - @ref project_file_circuit_xml "circuit.xml"
            - @ref project_file_project_xml "project.xml"
        
        
        @subsection project_dir_boards Directory "boards/"
        
            In this directory there are all boards (PCB layouts) saved.
            For each board, there is a seperate directory which is named by the board's name.
            But the directory name mustn't contain special characters:
                - only lower case letters, numbers and underlines are allowed - nothing more!
                - all other characters (including spaces) will be replaced with underlines
        
            See @subpage project_board "project board description" for more information.
    
    
        @subsection project_dir_lib Directory "lib/"
        
            In this directory there are all library elements (footprints, components, symbols, ...) saved which are needed in the project.
            Each element is saved in his own directory which are named with the element's uuid.
            These directories are 100 percent identical with the elements in the EDA4U library, these are 1:1 copies of them.
            
            If the user adds a new component to the project, this component and all its possible symbols, footprints and so on will be copied to this directory.
            If the user removes a component, that component and all its possible symbols, footprints and so on, which aren't needed by other components in the project,
            will be deleted immediately.
            
            See @ref library_documentation "library documentation" for more information.
    
    
        @subsection project_dir_panels Directory "panels/"
        
            In this directory there are all panels saved.
            For each panel, there is a seperate directory which is named by the panel's name.
            But the directory name mustn't contain special characters:
                - only lower case letters, numbers and underlines are allowed - nothing more!
                - all other characters (including spaces) will be replaced with underlines
        
            See @subpage project_panel "project panel description" for more information.
    
    
        @subsection project_dir_schematics Directory "schematics/"
        
            In this directory there are all schematics (pages) saved.
            For each schematic, there is a seperate directory which is named by the schematic's name.
            But the directory name mustn't contain special characters:
                - only lower case letters, numbers and underlines are allowed - nothing more!
                - all other characters (including spaces) will be replaced with underlines
        
            See @subpage project_schematic "project schematic description" for more information.
    
    
        @subsection project_dir_simulations Directory "simulations/"
        
            In this directory there are all simulations saved.
            For each simulation, there is a seperate directory which is named by the simulation's name.
            But the directory name mustn't contain special characters:
                - only lower case letters, numbers and underlines are allowed - nothing more!
                - all other characters (including spaces) will be replaced with underlines
        
            See @subpage project_simulation "project simulation description" for more information.
    
    
        @subsection project_dir_user Directory "user/"
        
            In this directory are all user related settings for that project saved.
            It's important to have all this data in one directory, so the user only needs to ignore one directory if he uses a version contol system.
            ALl data in this direcotory is not really important.
            
            @warning The user's version control system (if he uses one) needs to ignore this directory!

            See @subpage project_user "project's user related settings" for more information. 
    
    
        @subsection project_file_circuit_xml File "circuit.xml"
        
            This is the heart of every project. In this XML file there is the whole circuit with the netlist and all components saved.
            
            See @subpage project_circuit_xml "Project's circuit.xml Documentation"
    
    
        @subsection project_file_project_xml File "project.xml"
        
            In this XML file are general information of the project saved.
            
            See @subpage project_xml "Project's project.xml Documentation"
