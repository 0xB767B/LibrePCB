<!--
Please verify first that your request is not already reported on GitHub.

Attention: This issue tracker is only for "smaller" feature requests (e.g. "Make
layer colors configurable") or usability flaws (e.g. "Pressing Enter does not
close the dialog"). For fundamental, complex, large features (e.g. "Implement 3D
board viewer") please use our discussion platform instead so we can first
discuss how the feature should be implemented exactly:

you encountered. Provide screenshots if reasonable. -->
