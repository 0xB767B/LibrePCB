# LibrePCB Translation Files

This directory is intended to contain Qt translation files (*.ts) for the
LibrePCB application. But as we use Transifex to manage translations, these
translation files are not checked into this repository.

After installing the [Transifex CLI tool](https://docs.transifex.com/client/introduction),
the translation files can be downloaded/updated with following command:

```
tx pull -a
```
